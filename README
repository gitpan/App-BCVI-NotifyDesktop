App-BCVI-NotifyDesktop

This module is a plugin for 'bcvi' (see: http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-BCVI).
To use it, simply copy the NotifyDesktop.pm file to your $HOME/.config/bcvi/
folder.

The role of this plugin is to use the desktop notification protocol to take
messages sent from the 'bcvi' client and display them on the user's desktop
using the notification protocol.  This plugin implements the workstation-end
of the protocol.  You will also need to install another plugin to implement
the client-end (e.g.: App::BCVI::NotifyClient)
